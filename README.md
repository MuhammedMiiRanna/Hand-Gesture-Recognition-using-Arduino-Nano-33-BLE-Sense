# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-using-Arduino-Nano-33-BLE-Sense

## Project Objective:

The primary goal of this project was educational, undertaken during AC(creative workshop) classes under the guidance of Professor LARABI at University Of Science And Technology Houari Boumediene(USTHB). The project focused on developing a gesture recognition system for individuals with muteness using tiny machine learning and the knowledge acquired during the course. 

Our approach involved gathering accelerometer and gyroscope data from Arduino, labeling each file for the classification model's training. The trained models(2) were then deployed for both Arduino devices. The incorporation of BLE characteristics in the Arduino Nano 33 BLE facilitated the transmission of the predicted gesture's return value from one Arduino to another. Upon receiving the value, a straightforward comparison was performed to determine the final result.
